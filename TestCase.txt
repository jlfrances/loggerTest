Test Case:

1) Goal of test application is to look-up in the LOG file (please see attached zip file) all lines which match sub-string definitions stored in the separate config file. Matched lines as well as related statistics are written into special result file.
2) Format of result file is same like Filter1Result.txt in zip. It has to contain
	- Label for Sub-string patter used
	- Num of lines found
	- Full log line which match pattern
	- Line log number where pattern was found
3) Sub-strings are defined in special text file in same format like Filter1.def. File content must comply with following constrains
	- Line format is as follows: <label>,<search sub-string> on each line
	- Delimiter between parts is comma
	- Use same label two-more times is error
	- Comma is not allowed in label text
	- Label can’t be empty
	- sub-string pattern can’t be empty
4) Exe runs with command line parameters shown in file Run.
5) File Filter1Result.txt was directly generated out of Filter1.def definitions. You can use it for correctness testing.
